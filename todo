version 1 has been stopped (only bugfixes before release)

version 2 (roadmap):
* creating partition table, changing attributes (boot, fs type)
* formating of partition (no sure..., may be by exec of 'format'?)
* unpaking builtin image of DOS in winNT/2k/XP 
    allowing to make boot flash without MSDOS files not only on flash)

v 3 (long long way to go)
* advanced raw recovery (contintue reding after device replugging after fault)
